# BudgetMate
## Description
- Budget Mate is an application created using .net maui.
- This is designed to be a mobile application that will help you to financial freedom
- I made a couple itterations of this project with righteous revenue using swift but wanted to make it again using .net maui to allow for muli platform development and take new methods of displaying the information
- Also throuoght the years the way i approached my budgeting and spreadsheets changed. I decided to make the app reflect that in a more digestible way
  
## Use Case
A centralized place to keep track of account amounts, networth tracking, and savings roadmapping.
When used the right way you will be able to visually see where your money is going, where you can trim back, and where you will be in the future if you stick to the roadmap.
Alot of the apps out today have a subscription model for this type of luxury, and the alternative is you creating a spreadsheet for yourself to track your finances.
Depending on how this spreadsheet is constructed anyone else laying eyes on it I.E a significant other may get a headache from how the information is displayed.
I am an example of this my spreadsheet looks like number vomit to my wife at first but to me it makes perfect sense. 

## Future Plans after the initial Application is Created
I want to explore the possibility of adding a LLM to the application to look at expenses and income and give recommendations on ways to cut back to reach your desired goals.
